Final report 410421235:
(a) the way how you prepare the training samples:
	把題目給的圖先讀進來,再換成陣列形式,再經由老師上面所給的演算法來訓練資料
(b) all parameters, such as MaxlterLimit,a and e, you used for the training algorithm:
	epoch as Epoch
	ak as a(k)
	ek as E(k)
	w as w
	maxlimit as maxlterlimit
	a as a == 0.00001
	x = data
	x[0] as K1(k)
	x[1] as K2(k)
	x[2] as I(k)
(c) the derived weight vector w:
	It print in the code
(d) the print image I’ decrypted from E’
	It’s is the film name finalpicture.jpg
(e) the problem I encountered: 
	First I think the big problem is to understand how to open the picture and make it into a array, next use 	teacher’s algorithm to training the w and put w into the equation to find the finalpicture , I think the main 	problem still is to learn how to use python 套件 correct.
(f) what you have learned from this work:
	In this work, I understand python is a really powerful and simple language.
